# NWQSim: Northwest Quantum Circuit Simulation Environment 

A Quantum System Simulation Environment on classical multi-node, multi-CPU/GPU heterogeneous HPC systems. It currently includes a state-vector simulator SV-Sim ([SC'21](doc/svsim_sc21)) for high-performance ideal simulation, and a density matrix simulator DM-Sim ([SC'20](doc/dmsim_sc20)) for noise-aware simulation. It supports C++, Python, Q#/QIR, Qiskit, QASM, XACC as the front-ends, and X86/PPC CPU, NVIDIA/AMD GPU as the backends, see below:

## About SV-Sim

SV-Sim is implemented in C++/CUDA/HIP for general full-state quantum circuit simulation. It assumes qubits are all-to-all connected unless the input circuits are with respect to circuit topology. We use an array to store the internal gate representations and perform gate fusion for advanced performance.

### Prerequisite
SV-Sim generally only requires a C++ compiler. However, in order to build for GPUs or scaling (up and out) or using other APIs (python, qir, qiskit), we need the following libraries:

|  Dependency  | Version | Comments |
|:-----------: | ------- | -------- |
|     CUDA     | 11.0 or later | NVIDIA GPU backend only | 
|     GCC      | 7.0 or later  | Or other native C++ compiler |
|    OpenMP    | Local     | single-node only |
|     MPI      | Local   | CPU multi-node only | 
|   NVSHMEM    | 2.6.0   | NVIDIA GPU cluster scale-out only |
|  Python      | 3.4     | Python API only |
|  Pybind11    | 2.5.0   | Python API only |

### Configure and run on ORNL Summit Supercomputer

```
$ git clone https://github.com/qir-alliance/nwqsim.git 
$ cd nwqsim/env
```
You need to update the env file “setup_summit.sh”, specify the nvshmem path at the end of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you use Q#/QIR, you need to configure the qsharp runtime paths
```
$ source setup_summit.sh
$ cd ../qasm/ibmq_bench/
$ vim Makefile
```
You need to update the Makefile here, mainly the path to NVSHMEM, the GPU arch number, and the project number in run_all.lsf
```
$ make -j 8
$ bsub run_all.lsf
```
Alternatively, you can allocate an interactive job and execute
```
$ bsub -Is -W 20 -nnodes 2 -P CSCXXX  $SHELL
$ ./run_all
```

### Configure and run on NERSC Perlmutter Supercomputer
```
$ git clone https://github.com/qir-alliance/nwqsim.git 
$ cd nwqsim/env
```
You need to update the env file “setup_perlmutter.sh”, specify the nvshmem path at the end of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you use Q#/QIR, you need to configure the qsharp runtime paths
```
$ source setup_perlmutter.sh
$ cd ../svsim/qasm/ibmq_bench/
$ vim Makefile
```
You need to update the Makefile here, mainly the path to NVSHMEM.

## About DM-Sim

DM-Sim is implemented in C++/CUDA/HIP for general density-matrix quantum circuit simulation with noise. It needs to load backend device calibration data (including topology, T1, T2, SPAM, etc.) as a json file for runtime configuration to the simulator instance.  
We use an array to store the internal gate representations and perform density matrix gate fusion (with more restrictions compared to state-vector) for advanced performance.
